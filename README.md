# Data-Analysis
In this repository is shown how to use python in order to do different kind of data analysis. All the code has been written with the Jupyter Notebook IDE.

Here I analyse two differnt datasets and I try to answer to some basic questions in order to get meaningful informations from the data. 

The first analysis is about a descriptive statistic learning of the Titanic dataset available on the Kaggle platform, www.kaggle.com.
The second analysis is about the Stock Market prices of the most important tech company in the world.
